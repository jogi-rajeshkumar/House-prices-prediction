Predicting House Prices: Build a model to predict the sale price of a house based on its features such as size, 
location, number of bedrooms, etc. You can use any publicly available dataset such as the Boston Housing dataset 
or the House Prices dataset on Kaggle. This project can cover various topics in machine learning such as 
regression, feature engineering, and model selection.
